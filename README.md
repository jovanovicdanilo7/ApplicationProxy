# ApplicationProxy
Program includes Username/Password authentication and after it is done successfully, client sends file via proxy to the server.
First start the server, then the proxy and finally client.
Do not forget to set path in clients code, for file which you want to send to server.
Also you need to define path which server will use to place received file.
Pairs of correct username and passwords, which are defined as a map, you can see in code for proxy.
